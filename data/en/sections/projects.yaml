  repo: "" # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
  #url: ""  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: For this project we had to detect malware from windows executable files. The file normally called PE file, is first parsed and converted to a feature vector ( floating point array ). That vector along with some entropy and standard deviation calculations, is passed through a custom built feed forward part of neural network which outputs a score between 1-100 indicating if the file is infected.
